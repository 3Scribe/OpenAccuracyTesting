Oh man, um, so I remember the day of her birth was a beautiful sunny day. The day before though was raining and raining and raining and we went for a walk cause I was in labor and. She wasn't coming, she wasn't coming. And then, so they said go for a walk. And we went for a walk and we got back and it was pouring. And we just got soaked from head to toe and then Alexandra was born. Was it. No, I was gonna say that that rainy day was April 30th and she was born May 2nd, so it took a while, but she came. Yeah, it was, it was very exciting. Like, you know, the, the, there's a huge difference between the, the first child and the second child in terms of what you have to prepare for and like you don't know anything for the first, so it was uh an exciting time for sure. And uh we lived very close to the birth center, so when, when it was go time, we were there in a few minutes, but um, yeah, and then like it was a surreal experience coming uh coming back home with the child and And and with because we had a birth with a midwife, uh, we were home within 3 or 4 hours of the actual birth. And uh yeah, that was very surreal too, like we were super tired, so like, you know, you go to bed and like there's like basically this like infant in between you and you're like, oh my God, like we just brought a baby home and it's ours and we're responsible for it. So that was uh that that was very uh yeah, it was a wonderful experience, very scary, but uh yeah, it's, I have fond memories."}
