For 16 years, I've had the privilege of serving you as your member of Parliament, most recently as Deputy Prime Minister. We have worked hard together to make Ottawa South an excellent place to live, work and raise our families. But there's still more to do. That's why I'm pleased that David McGinty is running to be our next MP. I know David personally, and he understands our community. He'll get things done. He'll be a member of Parliament we can all be proud of. Please make sure you vote for David McGinty. Thank you."}
