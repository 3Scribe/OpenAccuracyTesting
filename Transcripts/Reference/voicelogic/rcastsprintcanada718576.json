{"Dataset":"voicelogic","KeyName":"rcastsprintcanada718576","Service":"Reference","Duration":56,"Transcript":"Important information about your phone service. You may receive a letter from Royal Bank Talk and Save urging you to authorize a change to your long-distance service. In fact, you have a choice. If you disregard this letter, your North America rate will be reduced to $0.06 a minute from $0.079, effective March 1st, and you don't have to do a thing. This is because Sprint Canada has always been a Talk and Save provider and wants to reward and thank you. Just look for almost 2 cents off every North American minute on your March invoice. We are also sending a letter in the next few days to confirm this commitment to you. If you have any further questions about the program, please visit www.sprint.ca/talk or call us at 1-888 or the number that appears on your invoice. Remember your rates will go down and you don't have to do a thing."}
