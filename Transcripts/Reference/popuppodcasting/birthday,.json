So I remember the day of her birth was a beautiful sunny day. The day before, though, was raining and raining and raining. And we went for a walk because I was in labor and she wasn't coming. She wasn't coming. And then so they said, go for a walk, and we went for a walk, and we got back, and it was pouring, and we just got soaked from head to toe. And then Alexandra was born. Was it 3:26am yeah. Is that what you mean? No, I was gonna say that that Rainy Day was April 30, and she was born May 2, So it took a while, but she came. Yeah, it was very exciting. There's a huge difference between the first child and the second child in terms of what you have to prepare for, and you don't know anything for the first. So it was an exciting time, for sure. And we lived very close to the birth center, so when it was go time, we were there in a few minutes, but. But, yeah, and then, like, it was a surreal experience coming. Coming back home with the child and. And with. Because we had a birth with a midwife, we were home within three or four hours of the actual birth. And, yeah, that was very surreal, too. Like, we were super tired. So, like, you know, you go to bed and, like, there's, like, basically this, like, infant in between you, and you're like, oh, my God. Like, we just brought a baby home, and it's ours, and we're responsible for it. So that was.  That was very. Yeah, it was a wonderful experience. Very scary. But, yeah, it's. I have fond memories."}
