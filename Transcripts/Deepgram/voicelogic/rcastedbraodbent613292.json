I'm calling to urge you to come to the Ottawa Center NDP nomination meeting this Tuesday at the Salis San Marco on Preston Street starting at six thirty. I'm also asking for your support. Together, I know we can win the seat. As a member of Jack Clayton's team in parliament, I will fight passionately for the issues that matter to our community and all Canadians. I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, and I hope I can count on your support. Thank you."}
