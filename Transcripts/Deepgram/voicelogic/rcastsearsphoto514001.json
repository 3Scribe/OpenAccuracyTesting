I know your little one will be celebrating a birthday soon, and I'm calling to remind you to book a photography session to help capture this special moment. And if you book your appointment within two weeks, you'll receive an extra eight by ten color portrait absolutely free with your purchase. Remember, portrait downstairs are a great way to mark your child's birthday, and portraits make wonderful gifts, especially for grandparents."}
