I do apologize for the inconvenience, but let me go ahead and check if there are some notes in the order details. May I ask, may I ask for the original on online order number? Okay. Let me see. Alright. Please, wait for a moment. Okay. Hold on. Okay. I believe it's, zero one seven one four two five seven nine three. Thank you. Just to verify, that's zero one seven one four two five seven nine three. Correct? Yes. That's right. I do apologize, but the one that you provided is, actually not accepting, towards our database. Do you actually have a number that starts with, triple zero seven or seven? Or, can I ask for your first and last name so I can manually check it in our database? Yeah.

Is that correct, Adam? Yes. Alright. Thank you for that information. Okay. Let me just quickly log in to our portal and check any notes in your order. Do you still have the return tracking from the courier company when you returned the item? Not sure. Is it the seven four three nine one? That's, actually the return authorization from coats and gowns. When you returned the item to the courier company for shipping, they should have provided you with the return tracking. Do you still have that? It's actually printed in the upper right part of the receipt. Okay. I probably have to dig it up. Okay. I imagine I have it somewhere, but, it might take some time to look for that. Oh, I see. Anyway, I tried to search for your name, and nothing is coming up. Can I ask for, the order under your name originally? Yeah. Yeah. It's under my name. So it's not under Andy or something? It's Adam? Yeah. Exactly. Thank you. Now what's the phone number that you put on the order before? Okay. Probably it's four eleven three four five zero three seven seven. Thank you. Just to make sure, that's four one one three four five zero three seven seven. Is that correct? Oh, zero three seven seven. Okay.

Now I just want to make sure that I have the correct details. Please hold hold on for a moment while we check on the details here in my end. Okay? Oh, sure. No problem. Alright. K. Thank you for patiently waiting, Adam. Now I actually or I can actually see here that you have called to inform us that you'd like to return the item on the fifteenth of November. Is that correct? Yes. Now did you return the item to courier company on the same day that you called? Probably close to it. I'm not really sure if it's on the same day, though, but probably just close to that day. I understand. However, upon checking the date that you actually called in for the return, it's already beyond the time frame that we ask for refunds. So what we'll do is I'll go ahead and forward this information to our corporate office, and I'll have them check and update you directly about the refund. Refund. So please expect an email within two to four business days. Is that okay with you? Two to four business days? Yes. No worries. I'll I will send it to, to them right now. Oh, really? Okay. Alright.
