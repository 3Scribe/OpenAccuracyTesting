I'm calling to urge you to come to the Ottawa Centre NDP nomination meeting this Tuesday at the Salas on Marco on Preston Street, starting at 6.30. I'm also asking for your support. Together, I know we can win the seat. As a member of Jack Layton's team in Parliament, I will fight passionately for the issues that matter to our community and all Canadians. I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, and I hope I can count on your support. Thank you."}
