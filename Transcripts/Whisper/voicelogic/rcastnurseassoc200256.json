I'm calling today to encourage you to vote in the provincial election this Thursday. Over the last months, I've seen more ONA members involved in election activities than ever before. Nurses are organizing meetings, working for candidates, wearing their I'm a nurse and I vote buttons, talking to the media and working on ONA's independent campaign. We know that four more years of Mike Harris will be a disaster for our patients and for nurses. We know our health care system is in a state of chaos. Our patients are suffering from four years of careless restructuring, hospital closures and underfunding. I believe this chaos is a direct result of conservative mismanagement and a deliberate plan to privatize large sectors of the system. Nurses have been strong advocates for change. We have called for restructuring which is planned and coordinated. Instead the Conservatives have torn our health care system apart. I believe we can stop the destruction. We can elect a government that cares about health care. As nurses, we must speak out about health care and try to fix it. Make your voice heard on Thursday. Vote to defeat the Harris Conservatives. For more information, look on the ONA website at www.ona.org. Thank you."}
