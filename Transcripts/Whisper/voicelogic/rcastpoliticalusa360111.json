Yesterday my husband's opponent sent a flyer in the mail attacking Steve for votes he missed last year while attending his father's funeral and settling the estate for his mother. His fellow council members know how loyal he is to his family and how seriously he takes his job. That's why his absence was officially excused, an important fact his opponent neglected to mention. Steve has returned more money to taxpayers from his district account than any other councilman in King County. He has the support of the local Republican Party and the King County Police Officers Guild. Please join me in supporting my husband Steve Hammond, your county councilman."}
