I'll be in town on Sunday for the Dartmouth-Coal Harbor nomination meeting to pick an NDP candidate to join me in taking on Paul Martin. We have four excellent candidates seeking the nomination and the meeting will be held at the Holiday Inn on Wise Road. Registration begins at 3 o'clock and the meeting starts at 430 sharp so please try to get there as early as you can because we're expecting a huge crowd. Hope to see you there!"}
