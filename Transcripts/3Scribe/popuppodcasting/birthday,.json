So I remember the day of her birth was a beautiful sunny day. The day before though was raining and raining and raining and we went for a walk because I was in labor and she wasn't coming, she wasn't coming. And then so they said, go for a walk. and we went for a walk and we got back and it was pouring. And we just got soaked from head to toe and then Alexandra was born. Was it? 3:26am yeah. Is that what you mean? No, I was gonna say that that rainy day was April 30th and she was born May 2nd so it took a while, but she came. Yeah, it was it was very exciting. There's a huge difference between the the first child and the second child in terms of what you have to prepare for and like you don't know anything for the first. So it was an exciting time for sure. And we lived very close to the birth center, so when when it was go time, we were there in a few minutes, but yeah, and then like it was a surreal experience coming coming back home with the child and And with. because we had a birth with a midwife, we were home within three or four hours of the actual birth. And yeah, that was very surreal too. Like, we were super tired. So like, you know, you go to bed and like there's like basically this like infant in between you and you're like, oh my God, like we just brought a baby home and it's ours and we're responsible for it. So that was That. That was very yeah, it was a wonderful experience, very scary. but yeah, it's. I have fond memories."}
